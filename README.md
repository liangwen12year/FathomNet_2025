This repository contains code and experiments for hierarchical taxonomic classification of marine species. The work is organized into two separate directories to clearly distinguish contributions.

## Directories

* **Wen\_Liang/**

  * Contains all code, experiments, and command-line running logs from Wen Liang.
  * Includes:

    * FathomNet data download scripts
    * Distance matrix generation
    * train_validation_test scripts

* **Kavin\_Aravindhan\_&\_Chhavi\_Dixit/**

  * Contains implementations, experiments, and logs by Kavin Aravindhan and Chhavi Dixit.
  * Includes:

    * Baseline models
    * Pipeline definitions
    * Experimental results

Each directory has its own `README.md` with detailed instructions and commands to reproduce the corresponding experiments.
